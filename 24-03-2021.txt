# What is Fastai?

- Fastai is a deep learning library that contains high level components that provide easy implementation for complicated tasks.
- Fastai is best implemented in REPL environments.
- REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop environments. Eg: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab.
- Hence, Fastai's entire documentation is written in jupyter notebooks.

# Features of Fastai?

- fastai does not show a traditional approach to python programming but instead adopts certain styles and practices from other languages too.
- fastai hosts a plethora of pre-defined datasets fir sommon problems, that can be downloaded and used with simple commands.
- In normal practice, python developers avoid using * to import everything from a library since it imports unwanted sub-libraries and other packages that may result in conflicts and bugs. But fastai solves this problem by importing only the necessary content when * is used.
- vision, text, tabular and collaborative filtering are 4 main predefined applications in fast.ai.

# What I did/learnt?

- Used fast.ai's vision library to train a simple model using a predefined dataset and classify images as containing cats or dogs.
- Learnt about Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDC) and the inputs-weights-model-result-performance-update structure of Machine Learning.
- Arthur Samuel devised the idea of using the loss function to improve the neural networks.
- In the fastai cats/dogs dataset, any image, with the first letter of its label in upper case, is an image of a cat. This helps in easier classification for training.
- Learnt about overfitting and proper fitting. One way to see if its not an over fit is by testing the model with data that was not used to train it.
- fastai has multiple functionalities and datasets that can also be used for image segmentation, imdb score prediction, salary prediction, etc.

# Looking forward to Learning more!
