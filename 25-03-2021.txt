# Features of Fastai

- fastai comes with a download_url function that helps download images right off the internet.
- fastai defaults the valid_percent feature to 0.2, i.e., it automatically creates a validation set for you using 20% of the data.
- The key focus of the fastai library is "Transfer Learning". Transfer learning uses less data and gives high accuracies.
- ULMFit is an approach by fastai developers to perform protein analysis using NLP. this is done by considering the different types of proteins as different words.

# Learning Updates

- The 2 main types of Machine Learning -  classification and regression.
- Classification - predicting a category.
- Regression - predicting a number or pattern.
- Overfitting - When you train the model for too long using less data, the accuracy starts to get worse.
- Epoch - A cycle in which we iterate through every single data in the dataset.
- Fine Tuning - - FIne Tuning is a transfer Learning technique where the weights of a pretrained model are updated by training for additional epochs using a different task than that used for pretraining.
- Inference - Using the trained model in required applications.
- Resnet - An architecture commonly used for computer vision problems. The number 34 refers to the number of layers and may vary.
- Modelzoo - A good recommendation to search for pretrained models.
- Learnt to use the datablock api and DataLoaders.
- Learnt to export and save the trained model to a pickle file.
- Error rate is a metric that tests the model with the val data.
- Loss function is used by the computer to make the model better

# Looking forward to Learning more!
