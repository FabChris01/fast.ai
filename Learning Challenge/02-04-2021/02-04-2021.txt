# Learning Updates

- The 2 main types of Machine Learning -  classification and regression.
- Classification - predicting a category.
- Regression - predicting a number or pattern.
- Overfitting - When you train the model for too long using less data, the accuracy starts to get worse.
- Epoch - A cycle in which we iterate through every single data in the dataset.
- Fine Tuning - - FIne Tuning is a transfer Learning technique where the weights of a pretrained model are updated by training for additional epochs using a different task than that used for pretraining.
- Inference - Using the trained model in required applications.
- Resnet - An architecture commonly used for computer vision problems. The number 34 refers to the number of layers and may vary.
- Modelzoo - A good recommendation to search for pretrained models.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
