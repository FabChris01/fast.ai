# Learning Updates
- Multi-label classification refers to the problem of identifying the categories of objects in an image, 
- In such cases, you may not have exactly one type of object in the image.
- This is useful for object detection in images that have multiple classes of objects to be detected.
- Learnt how to handle Datasets and tabular data using Pandas and dataframes.
- A dataframe uses the iloc or the integer location property to iterate or enumerate the items in the data list.
- Discretizing is Taking a model that has already been trained with 16-bit or 32-bit floating point and then round it off.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
