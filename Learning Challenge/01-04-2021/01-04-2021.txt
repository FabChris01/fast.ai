- fastai defaults the valid_percent feature to 0.2.
- It automatically creates a validation set for you using 20% of the data. 
- The key focus of the fastai library is "Transfer Learning". 
- Transfer learning uses less data and gives high accuracies.
- ULMFit is an approach by fastai developers to perform protein analysis using NLP.
