# Learning Updates
- Algorithms are used differently than human decision makers:
1) People are more likely to assume algorithms are objectibe or error-free (even if they're given the option of a human override)
2) Algorithms are more likely to be implemented with no appeals process in place
3) Algorithms are often used at scale
4) Algorithmic systems are cheap
- According to Cathy O'Neil, "The privileges are processed by people; the poor are processed by algorithms.
- Learnt about Disinformation which includes orchestrated campaigns of manipulation.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
