# Learning Updates
- Learnt about Natural Language Processing (NLP) in fastai.
- Modern NLP depends heavily on self-supervised learning, and in particular the use of language models.
- Pretrained language models are fine-tuned, in order to benefit from transfer learning. 
- Unlike computer vision, fine-tuning in NLP can take advantage of an extra step, which is the use of self-supervised learning on the target dataset.
- Before we can do any modeling with text data, we first have to tokenize and numericalize it. 
- There are a number of approaches to tokenization, and which you choose will depend on your language and dataset.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
