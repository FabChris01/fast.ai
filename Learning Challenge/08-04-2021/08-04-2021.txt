# Learning Updates
- fastai has a built in function called plot_function that makes it easier for plotting graphs instantaneously
- Picking a learning rate is a vital step of training a model
- A learning rate should be picked such that, it reduces the loss effectively and doesn't take a long time doing so.
- Arthur samuel defined in the following terms: 
    = Suppose we arrange for some automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performance and provide a mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance. 
    = We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would learn from its experience.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
