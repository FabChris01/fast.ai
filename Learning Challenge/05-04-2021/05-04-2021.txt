# Learning Updates
- one of the salient features of fastai is that it had built in UI widgets.
- This helps developers who dont know web development deploy their model in jupyter notebook by creating their own widgets and ui with just a few lines of code. 
- This feature was written with the help of voila
- Binder can be used to host your fastbook application on a virtual server.
- It provides you with a url that can be shared with and accessed by anyone.
- This uses the CPU, and not the GPU
- But if you're going to be hosting models that process video, etc it is better to run it on a gpu
- Out of domain data is a situation where the data that want to do inference on is somehow different than the data used in training.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
