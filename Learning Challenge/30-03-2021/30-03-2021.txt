# Learning Updates

- Fastai does not show a traditional approach to python programming 
- Instead, it adopts certain styles and practices from other languages too.
- Fastai hosts a plethora of pre-defined datasets for sommon problems.
- These preprocessed and readily available datasets can be downloaded and used with simple commands.
- In normal practice, python developers avoid using * to import everything from a library since it imports unwanted sub-libraries and other packages that may result in conflicts and bugs. 
- But fastai solves this problem by importing only the necessary content when * is used.
- Vision, text, tabular and collaborative filtering are 4 main predefined applications in fast.ai.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
