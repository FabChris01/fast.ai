# Learning Updates
- Learnt about the uses of arrays and tensors in Training a model 
- Also learnt about view and the @ operator.
- Looked into calculation of gradients used in a pytorch training loop
- Created a deep neural network from scratch by adding non-linearities with ReLU
- Also learnt about the softmax activation function. 
- The softmax activation function is used in a lot of non-binary classification models.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
