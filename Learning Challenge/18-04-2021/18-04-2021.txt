# Learning Updates
- The error rate is calculated as 1-accuracy
- Accuracy only works for single label datasets like MNIST and pets datasets.
-  It takes in the final layer of activations as input and applies the argmax function.
- The argmax function returns the index of the largest number in the activations
- It then checks this value with the target and returns the accuracy
- Hence, argmax only makes sense when there's a single maximum thing.
- So, in multilabel classifications, we compare each activation to a predefined threshold
- We did this using a built in python function called partial


# Looking forward to Learning more!
