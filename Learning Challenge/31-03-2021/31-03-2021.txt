# Learning Updates

- Used fast.ai's vision library to train a simple model using a predefined dataset and classify images as containing cats or dogs.
- Learnt about Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDC) and the inputs-weights-model-result-performance-update structure of Machine Learning.
- Arthur Samuel devised the idea of using the loss function to improve the neural networks.
- In the fastai cats/dogs dataset, any image, with the first letter of its label in upper case, is an image of a cat. This helps in easier classification for training.
- Learnt about overfitting and proper fitting. One way to see if its not an over fit is by testing the model with data that was not used to train it.
- fastai has multiple functionalities and datasets that can also be used for image segmentation, imdb score prediction, salary prediction, etc.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
