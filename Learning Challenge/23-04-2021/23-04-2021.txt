# Learning Updates
- The Final prediction of a random forest of the average of the presictions of the leaf node.
- Random forests cannot extrapolate outside of th bounds of the data that they have as a training set.
- Also learnt about the limitations of decision tree approaches, when it comes to extrapolation, and looked at ways to solve it.
- Used deep learning for tabular analysis, and looked into ways to create ensembles of multiple types of model.
- Using these approaches, we then found a Kaggle solution that appears to be at, or close to, the top of the leaderboard in a popular competition.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
