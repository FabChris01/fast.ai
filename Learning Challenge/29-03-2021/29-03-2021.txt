# What is Fastai?

- Fastai is a deep learning library that contains high level components that provide easy implementation for complicated tasks.
- Fastai was developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger.
- fastai can be easily installed on any machine using the command: conda install -c fastai -c pytorch -c anaconda fastai gh anaconda. Using conda is highly recommended.
- Fastai is best implemented in REPL environments.
