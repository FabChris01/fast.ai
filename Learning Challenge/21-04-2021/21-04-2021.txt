# Learning Updates
- Modern Machine learning can be distilled down to a couple of key techniques that are widely applicable. 
- Recent studies have shown that the vast majority of datasets can be best modeled with just two methods
1) Ensembles of decision trees, mainly for structured data
- Some examples are random forests and gradient boosting machines
2) Multilayered neural networks learnt with SGD (i.e., shallow and/or deep learning)
- These are mainly for unstructured data such as, audio, vision and natural language.
- Pytorch is more suitable for gradient based methods while scikit learn is suitable for random forest methods and such other techniques
- feature engineering is a technique where we take a piece of data and try to create other pieces of data from it


# Looking forward to Learning more!
