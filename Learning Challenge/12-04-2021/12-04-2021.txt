# Learning Updates
- Learnt about ethics in deep learning and the legal system governing it.
- Ethics is not the same as religion, law, a fixed set of rules or social norms
- Ethics is :
1) well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do
2) the study and development of one's ethical standards
- The common issue with ethics is that the systems are implemented with no way to identify and address mistakes


# Looking forward to Learning more!
