# Learning Updates
- Learnt about regular expressions in python
- re is a python module and using the findall function returns all the instances of that pattern
- RegexLabeller is a handy fastai class that labels things with a regular expression
- Softmax functions are the advanced versions of SIgmoid functions when you want to use multiple categories instead of just 2
- softmax always gives you numbers between 0 and 1 anf they always add up  to 1
- The logarithm function is used to covert the values in range 0 to 1 to range - infinity to + infinity to eliminate accuracy loss.
- If the value's going towards 0, it becomes infinity and if its going towards 1, it becomes 0
- pytorch has a predefined function called log_softmax that finds the log and gives it to the nll_loss function


# Looking forward to Learning more!
