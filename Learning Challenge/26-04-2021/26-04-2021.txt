# Learning Updates
- For Natural Language Processing, The tokenizer used by fastai is spaCy
- spaCy seperates the sentences into words and puntuations. It also knows not to seperate certain notations such as abbreviations and keywords.
- It uses xxbos to indicate the beginning of a document.
- It converts all uppercase letters to lowercase and inserts a "ccmaj" before them to indicate the conversion.
- In Transfer learning, you take a pre trained model and remove the final layer.
- We then train the model with our own dataset for it to replace the existing final layer with our new information.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
