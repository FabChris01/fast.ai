# Learning Updates
- Learnt about Recognizing hand written digits using the MNIST dataset 
- It was used to provide one of the first computer systems that could practically recognize hand written digits
- This system was named LeNet-5 and was used to process 10% of the checks in the US
- Worked with a simpler version of the MNIST dataset that contains only 3s and 7s
- untar_data is a function in fastai 
- This function, takes a url, checks whether you've already downloaded and if you've not already downloaded it, it downloads it for you. 
- It also checks if you've already uncompressed it, and if you haven't already, it uncompressed it for you and then finally returns its path.
- tensor is the pytorch version of a numpy array
- The pytorch tensor is used widely and is better than a numpy array because it can also be computed on a GPU.
- show_image is a fastai function that displays a tensor


# Looking forward to Learning more!
