# Learning Updates
- Learnt about slicing tensors and how to manipulate them
- Broadcasting is a technique that helps you use python as a very very high level programming language
- the fundamental principle of broadcasting is elemen-wise operations
- Also learnt about the basic steps, for the process of training a model to differentiate between 3s and 7s
    = Initialize the weights,
    = For each image, use the weights to predict whether it appears to be a three or a seven.
    = based on these predictions, calculate how good the model is (its loss)
    = Calculate the gradient, which measures for each weight, how changing that weight would change the loss
    = Change the weights based on the calculation
    = and go back and repeat the process until the training is over.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
