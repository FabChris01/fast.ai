# Learning Updates

- resize is a item transform function
- it is used to resize images to a uniform size by stretching it or squishing it
- because before yopu feed images into the model, they should be of  the same size
- resizing to a square is the most efficient method
- resize stretches or squishes while .pad adds black padding so the original image doesnt get disfigured
- Randomresizedcrop is the best resize method since it produced a set of images that are parts of the original image. this prevents overfitting while training the model.
- item transform happens one at a time whereas batch transform applies the changes to a batch
- aug_transforms changes the properties of an image like contrast, color, etc
- ImageClassifierCleaner helps you with data cleaning


# Looking forward to Learning more!
