# Learning Updates
- Data Augmentation could be used in Natural Language Processing to achieve higher accuracies with less data.
- Data Augmentation with text datasets could be done by fetching the synonyms of the words in the dataset or translating them to other languges and back to induce rephrasing.
- RNN or Recurrent Neural networks are made by refactoring a simple neural network into loops.
- Hidden state refers to the activations that occur inside a recurrent neural network.
- detach is a function that is used to forget the current gradient history. This helps reduce the amount of calculations and during back propagation. This is called truncated Backpropagation.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
