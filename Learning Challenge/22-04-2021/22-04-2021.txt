# Learning Updates
- Learnt about bagging which is a way to get deep trees without overfitting
- Also Learnt about Breiman's bagging procedure which is a very efficient technique to train random forest classfiers
- In this procedure, the the dataset is split into several smaller subsets
- Each subset is then used as a dataset to train a model of its own
- Hence, a model is trained for each subset of the dataset
- During prediction, All the models are used for predicting
- The final prediction result is obtained by taking the average of the predictions of all the models.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
