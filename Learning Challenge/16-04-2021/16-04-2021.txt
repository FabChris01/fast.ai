# Learning Updates
- Learnt about the cross entropy loss function and its benefits
1) It works even when our dependent variable has more than 2 categories
2) It results in faster and more reliable training
- Determining the learning rate for a model is an important step in training
- A high learning rate results in More losses and vice versa.
- Leslie smith came up with the learning rate finder
- The Learning Rate finder uses a trail and error method starting ftom a low rate and moving up gradually to find the optimal rate.


# Looking forward to Learning more!
